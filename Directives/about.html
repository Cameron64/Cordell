<h1> About Me </h1>

    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hey there! I’m Cole Cordell, a native Texan from the Lewisville area who is currently studying acting as well as business marketing at Southern Methodist University. I've always loved to act. The first production I was ever in was Christmas at the OK Corral when I was in second grade. Ever since that moment, I knew I wanted to pursue acting. </p>

   <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Throughout my formative years, I began taking an increasing number of acting classes as well as going out on auditions in the Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth areas. During middle school and early high school I had the pleasure of working on two commercials, a FOX TV show (The Good Guys), and a Hallmark Movie (Front of the Class). </p> <br>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After my film, television, and commercial debuts, I took the road of stage acting in high school. I was fortunate enough to be cast in many roles such as Hal Carter in William Inge’s Picnic. I was also Adolfo Pirrelli in Sweeney Todd, Phil Davis in Irving Berlin’s White Christmas, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Chemical Imbalance, and many other roles as well. </p> <br>

    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I've always loved the thrill that performing live gave me. There is a certain clarity that you get when you’re performing on stage; there truly isn’t anything like it. </p> <br>

    <p>After high school, I packed my bags and made the short trip down to Dallas where I will continue my academic and artistic journey for the next four years!</p>
